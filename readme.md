Hello, to Fundamentals of Machine learning!  You have just landed to a page where
you can learn how to generate book contents like this one using the **Jupyterbook**

For this book we have already creat a structure which is as below:

> fml_book_content \ \
>  \ dataset \
>   \ images \
>  \ notebooks \
>  ..

```
Note: you can use ' git clone https://github.com/ammaryasirnaich/fml_book.git ' to clone this structure locally.
```
