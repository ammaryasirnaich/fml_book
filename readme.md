Hello to Fundamentals of Machine learning!  You have just landed to the page where
you can learn how to generate book contents like this one using the **Jupyterbook**
You can install jupyterbook with pip or conda:

> pip install -U jupyter-book \
> or \
> conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-book

# Quickly generate a sample book
You can creat a sample book which works as a template to re-structure the contents and the look and feel of the book
To generate this template book structure you just have to run the below command.
```
jupyter-book create mynewbook
```

# Or using the already created Structure
For this book we have already creat a structure which is as below:

> fml_book_content \ \
>  ..\ dataset \
>  ..\ images \
>  ..\ notebooks \
>  ..

```
Note: you can use ' git clone https://github.com/ammaryasirnaich/fml_book.git ' to clone this structure localy.
```
