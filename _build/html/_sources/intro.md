# Welcome to Principles of Machine Learning Book

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
ECS7020P Principles of Machine Learning covers the fundamental concepts, methodology and practical tools necessary to understand, build and assess data-driven models to describe real-world systems and predict their behaviour. We will follow the standard machine learning taxonomy to organise problems and techniques into well-defined families (supervised and supervised learning) and subfamilies. We will pay particular attention to the methodology that we need to use to avoid and identify common pitfalls. State-of-the-art models and the latest developments on model deployment will be discussed.
